h3. Some commands repeatedly used to configure my Cisco switches

I hate to burden my long term memory with something so apoetic as commands for a Cisco switch. I mean, I love to remember lyrics (like Thick As A Brick), and sometimes parts of books, parts of language that I want to be part of, by knowing them by heart. 

After logging in and in enable mode:
@#configure terminal@ Ready for commands that edit the configuration
@(config)#interface range GigabitEthernet0/1 - 48@ configure all 48 interface ports at once with the following commands
@(config-if)#macro apply cisco-desktop $access_vlan 1017@ run this macro on the interface ports to set them for vlan nr. 1017. 
@^Z@ This exits configure mode
@#copy running<TAB> startup<TAB>@ making the changes permanent through restart. Uses autofill by the TAB key.

Then just run reload .
