h3. Some fun with Textile markup language

Just changed my Rakefile (Why does that rhyme with Makefile), according to "this site":http://octopress.org/docs/configuring/, so that posts would by default be created with @.textile@ suffix. 

Changed this: 
@'post_ext' => "md",@
to this: 
@'post_ext' => "textile",@

It worked beautifully, so I wrote this post about it. When I tried to render it, Ruby complained:  %{color:red}Missing dependency: RedCloth% 

Did @gem install RedCloth@ as "given here":http://redcloth.org/

Now it just works.
