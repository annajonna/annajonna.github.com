Got some problems with Apache and php-fpm cgi module, cause the load is going skywards. My attention is constantly caught by a bottle of fresh organic ginger juice, mixed with rests of fresh organic tumeric juice that my friend gave me. This is some strong stuff. 

However I am not going to use strong medicine to solve the Apache problem. Just going to move those webs to the cluster. Then I will use the script @vhosts-create.sh@ script found on my "github here":https://github.com/annajonna/wordpress-vhost-create/blob/master/bin/vhost-create.sh .

By the way: This post was created with this command: 
@rake post title="Fresh ginger juice and Apache problems" category="web" tags=["apache, juice"]@
Im growing a strange kind of affection towards this Jekyll and JB(Jekyll Bootstrap) .
